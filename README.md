# How Does a Database Work? (but in poorly written Go)
A toy database in Go, roughly following the [How Does a Database Work?](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/) by Connor Stack.

My main goals here are fairly modest:
- get familiar with the Go language
- learn more about data structures, software architecture, and just organizing code in a project bigger than `fmt.Println("hello world")`
- better understand the internals of databases
